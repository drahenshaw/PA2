 *Date: September 11, 2017																								 *
 *Description: This program evaluates eight different equations based upon user input.									 *
 *              Prompts the user for which values to use in the equations,												 *
 *			    and uses custom functions to solve for the calculations.												 *              
 *              The equations are displayed with the constants and results.											     *
 *																											             *
 *              Inputs: acceleration, mass, radius, height,																 *
 *                      plaintext_character, mass1, mass2, distance, theta,											     *
 *                      R1, R2, R3, x1, x2, y1, y2,																	     *
 *                      x, z, a																					         *
 *              Constants: PI, G																						 *
 *              Computations: See relevant formulas																         *
 *              Outputs: force, volume_cylinder, encoded_character,														 *
 *                       tan_theta, parallel_resistance, distance_points, y												 *
 *																													     *
 *              This program does not provide error checking.														     *
 *              This program contains a custom header and a second source file for custom function definitions.			 *
 *																														 *
 * Relevant Formulas: The equations are referenced in the following comments of the program							     *
 *          (1)Newton's 2nd Law: force = mass_newton * acceleration													     *
 *          (2)Volume of a cylinder: volume_cylinder = PI * radius^2 * cylinder_height							         *
 *          (3)Character encoding: encoded_character = 10 + (plaintext_character - 'a') + 'A'							 *
 *          (4)Gravity: force = G * mass1 * mass2 / distance^2															 *
 *          (5)Tangent: tan_theta = sin (theta) / cos (theta)															 *
 *          (6)Total parallel resistance: parallel_resistance = 1 / (1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + 1 / R3)							 *
 *          (7)Distance between two points: distance_points = square root of ((x1 - x2)^2 +								 *
 *                                                                            (y1 - y2)^2)								 *
 *          (8)General equation:  y = (7 / 5) * x / a + z - a / (a % 2) + PI   											 *
